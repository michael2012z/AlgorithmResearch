# Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming applies when the subproblems overlapthat is, when subproblems share subsubproblems. 
A dynamic-programming algorithm solves each subsubproblem just once and then saves its answer in a table, thereby avoiding the work of recomputing the answer every time it solves each subsubproblem.

## Steps
When developing a dynamic-programming algorithm, we follow a sequence of
four steps:
1. Characterize the structure of an optimal solution.
2. Recursively define the value of an optimal solution.
3. Compute the value of an optimal solution, typically in a bottom-up fashion.
4. Construct an optimal solution from computed information.

## Cases
### Rod cutting

### Matrix-chain multiplication

### Longest common subsequence
